# Time-Series-Analysis

This repository contains materials related to time series analysis, a statistical method used to analyze sequences of data points ordered in time.  The materials cover both theoretical concepts and practical Python implementations for forecasting and understanding time-based data.

## Contents

The repository includes the following:

* **Jupyter Notebooks:**
    * [GoogleStock.ipynb](./GoogleStock.ipynb):  Analysis of Google stock price data.
    * [TimeSeries.ipynb](./TimeSeries.ipynb):  General time series analysis techniques and examples.
    * [TimeSeriesMine.ipynb](./TimeSeriesMine.ipynb):  Additional time series analysis implementations.
* **Documents:**
    * [Time Series Analysis using Python.docx](./Time%20Series%20Analysis%20using%20Python.docx):  In-depth explanations of time series analysis concepts and Python implementation.
    * [Time Series Analysis using Python.txt](./Time%20Series%20Analysis%20using%20Python.txt):  A text version of the document.

## Key Concepts and Techniques Covered

This repository provides information and examples related to the following key concepts and techniques in time series analysis:

* **Time Series Data vs. Non-Time Series Data**: Understanding the difference.
* **Components of Time Series Data**: Identifying trend, seasonality, and residuals.
* **Decomposition Models**: Additive and multiplicative models.
* **Forecasting Techniques**:
    * Moving Average
    * Exponential Smoothing
    * Seasonal Indexes
    * ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average)
* **Stationarity**: Concepts and how to achieve it.
* **Differencing**:  d and D parameters.
* **ACF and PACF**:  Autocorrelation and Partial Autocorrelation Functions.
* **SARIMA**: Seasonal ARIMA
* **Model Selection**: p, d, q parameters.
* **Evaluation Metrics**:  RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error).

## Target Audience

This repository is suitable for:

* Students learning data analysis and time series forecasting.
* Anyone interested in understanding and applying time series analysis techniques.
* Anyone wanting to learn how to forecast time series data using Python.
